## Mega Rocket SA
```sh
Is a gym with members and employees that asked us to develop a web system that facilitates the management of its schedule grid and the trainers in charge of each class, so that its members can register dynamically without exceeding the available seats.
```
## WEEK 01
In the first week we designed the landing page of the gym in Figma, which consists of a monthly management system so that members and trainers can dynamically register for their activities in the gym.
>The system has different sections.
- Header with a company logo
- Sidebar
- Features
- About Mega Rocket
- Get in touch
- Gym activities
- Memberships
- Footer
## WEEK 02
I made an HTML document with all the content that appears in the Figma landing, for this I used the semantic elements of HTML
>GitHub: use it to create a public repository and save progress

>Git: I used it to link the folder where I was working with the github repository
