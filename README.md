# Become a Software Professional M-2023
## Mega Rocket SA
```sh
Is a gym with members and employees that asked us to develop a web system that facilitates the management of its schedule grid and the trainers in charge of each class, so that its members can register dynamically without exceeding the available seats.
```
## WEEK 01
In the first week we designed the landing page of the gym in Figma, which consists of a monthly management system so that members and trainers can dynamically register for their activities in the gym.
>The system has different sections.
- Header with a company logo
- Sidebar
- Features
- About Mega Rocket
- Get in touch
- Gym activities
- Memberships
- Footer
## WEEK 02
I made an HTML document with all the content that appears in the Figma landing, for this I used the semantic elements of HTML
>GitHub: use it to create a public repository and save progress

>Git: I used it to link the folder where I was working with the github repository
## WEEK 03
I included the styles corresponding to the HTML structure in order to recreate the Figma landing in desktop view.
For this purpose I created a CSS file and used the same github repository from week 02 to link my progress.
## WEEK 04
During this week I replicated the Figma landing page using flexbox with the aim of creating a responsive design following the mobile first concept
> GitHub Pages: allows me to view the front page online from the Github page

>CSS Flexbox: allows the same content to be adapted for mobile phones, tablets and desktop
## WEEK 05
During week 05 the activities were divided into two blocks:
- Block 1: JavaScript exercises, which had six sections:
01. Variables and operators
02. Strings
03. Arrays
04. If/else
05. For
06. Functions

- Block 2: on the other hand, considering the feedback from the tutor and assistant on week 04, I implemented the suggested corrections.
> GitHub Pages and Git:
I continued using them to link my progress to the repository.
